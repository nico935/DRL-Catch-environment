# Game of Catch

In this assignment, you will implement various RL algorithms that learn the game of Catch. For exact description, refer to the assignment description on Brightspace.

## Installation

Before running the code, make sure you properly install the dependencies:

```
python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

The code has been tested with Python 3.11.

## Running the code

Now, you should be able to simply run the `main.py` as any other script.

In order to allow us for easy grading, we implemented a simple test that checks wheter your `requirements.txt` file is complete and that your code runs without errors. You can run this test by executing the following command:

```
source test.sh
```

## Tips and Resources

Here are a couple of hints and resources that might help you with in this assignment:

1. To help you out with technical writing, check out these papers for inspiration. Reading real scientific papers can help you out with using correct nomenclature and ensuring a clear structure. In particular, you can draw inspiration as to how complex concepts and formulas are introduced
   and explained.

   a. Technical Report on implementing RL algorithms in CartPole environment - https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.04938.pdf

   b. Paper summarising usage of RL in Chess - https://page.mi.fu-berlin.de/block/concibe2008.pdf

2. If you have duplicate code in multiple places, itâ€™s probably a bad sign. Maybe you should try it to group that functionality in a seperate function?
3. The agent should be able to learn using different types of algorithms. Maybe there is a way to make these algorithms easily swappable?
4. Type hinting is not required, but it can help your partner understand your code - https://mypy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/cheat_sheet_py3.html
5. Git workshop by Cover - https://studysupport.svcover.nl/?a=1
6. YouTube Git tutorial - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGOj5yH7evk

## Questions and help

If you are struggling with one part of the assignment, you're probably not alone. That's why we want to create a small FAQ throughout the next couple of weeks. In case of a question, raise an issue in the original, template repository: [https://github.com/Deep-Reinforcement-Learning-RUG/catch-assignment](https://github.com/Deep-Reinforcement-Learning-RUG/catch-assignment). We will answer your questions there, so that there are no duplicate questions.
